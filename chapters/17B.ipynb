        "\n",
        "`instructor` is a lightweight Python library that provides a convenient wrapper around the client of the OpenAI compatible servers, adding validation of JSON responses from an LLM. Instructor uses the Pydantic library, which allows users to specify models for JSON schemas and data validation, ensuring that LLM responses adhere to the defined schema.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Key Features\n",
        "- **Easy integration** Seamlessly integrates with several LLMs beyond OpenAI. See:\n",
        "    - Working with different providers: https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/hub/\n",
        "    - Examples: https://jxnl.github.io/instructor/examples/\n",
        "    - If needed, you can also use [ChatGPT-instructor](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-EvZweRWrE-instructor-gpt/) to get a code snippet.\n",
        "- **Data validation**: Ensure the JSON response from a LLM meets the specified schema. See:\n",
        "    - https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/\n",
        "- **Retry Management**: Retries with error guidance if the LLM returns invalid responses. You can set the maxium number of retries.\n",
        "- **Streaming Support**: Work with Lists and Partial responses effortlessly\n",

        "Pydantic models are classes that inherit from pydantic.BaseModel. They offer several key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Data Validation**: Models automatically validate input data, ensuring that it conforms to the defined field types and constraints.\n",
        "- **Type Hinting**: Models leverage Python's type annotations, providing clear type information for fields.\n",
        "- **Serialization**: Models can easily convert to and from JSON, making them ideal for API development.\n",
        "- **Schema Generation**: Pydantic can automatically generate JSON schemas from models, useful for documentation and API specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a Pydantic model, simply define a class that inherits from `BaseModel`. In the next code block, fields can be customized using the `Field` function. We are also using `typing` package. With the combination of these two packages, we can force the LLM to only response in the desired format:\n",
        "- `str`: Free from response. There is no limitation for the model. Although we can use max_length to limit the field.\n",
        "- `Literal`: Imagine that is similar to multiple choice question. LLM can only choose one of them.\n",
        "- `List`: LLM would return multiple objects in a list. We are using `List` in tandem with `Literal` to force LLM return in a specific terminology, like checking the checkboxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    **N.B.:** the term 'model' is used heavily in AI. When we refer to Pydantic 'model' we do not mean an AI or LLM model. Instead, it means a model of how the data should be represented."
